# Hello, World

Welcome to Flow blockchain, Let's call a contract on Testnet.
## Calling a contract
On Testnet, `HelloWorld` Contract has a public variable named `greeting`, we'll use a Script to get it's value. For the purposes of this quick start, we are embedding Flow Runner website to run a script against Testnet. For reference [Flow Runner](https://runflow.pratikpatel.io/) website


```
import HelloWorld from 0x9dca641e9a4b691b

pub fun main(): String {
  return HelloWorld.greeting
}
```
`Copy` the script above into Flow Runner and click "Execute Script" Then scroll down to see the output. Ignore the `red underline` of HelloWorld. Fixing this will be in future learnings.

## Contract on Testnet

Here is the `HelloWorld` contract, Continue to other getting started examples to learn how to call `changeGreeting` to change the greeting value. 
```
pub contract HelloWorld {

  pub var greeting: String

  pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String) {
    self.greeting = newGreeting
  }

  init() {
    self.greeting = "Hello, World!"
  }
}
```
