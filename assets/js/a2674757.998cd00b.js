Why do we need to do this?**:  Without special privileges and in all major container runtimes, a container will not run with the `CAP_SYS_TIME` capability. For Flow, this means that the node software itself cannot change the time of the host machine, making the in-container use of standard time synchronization protocols ineffective.\n\n- **Why does time matter in Flow?**: Time information comes up in consensus and in smart contracts. The consensus algorithm of Flow allows nodes to exit the influence of a corrupt or ineffective "leader" node by collectively deciding to switch to the next "phase" of the protocol at the right time. The smart contract language also allows developer access to block time stamps, which provide an approximation of time. To resist manipulation in each case, honest nodes must compute timing values from an aggregate of the information provided by all nodes. That approach, though resilient, is still sensitive to inaccurate time information.
